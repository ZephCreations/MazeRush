# MazeRush

## What is it?
MazeRush is a 2D game made entirely in native python with no external libraries. 
The premise of the game is very simple, be the first to the flag to win. 
You can currently play up to four players on the same device, however, 
networked multiplayer is in the works

## How can I play it
Go to the [latest releases](https://github.com/ZephCreations/MazeRush/releases/latest) of the project and find the latest version (Currently V1.0) and download the files.
If you have python installed then you will be able to run the file 
`/Main/main.pyw`
and play the game, no installation necessary.

In future the game may be available as an executable file,
allowing it to run without a valid python installation.
A website with the game download and means of supporting development is also a future goal.

## Code Contributions
Contributions to this project would be appreciated, whether colour schemes or functionality.
Certain features may not be in development or in the current scope, so recommendations for
features or bug fixes etc. would be welcome.

Feedback on the game is also appreciated as it helps with feature development and refining the game.
